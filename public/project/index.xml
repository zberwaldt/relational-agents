      <title>Palliative Care Agent</title>

      <description>The purpose of this project is to develop a conversational agent system that counsels terminally ill patients in order to alleviate their suffering and improve their quality of life.
Although many interventions have now been developed to address palliative care for specific chronic diseases, little has been done to address the overall quality of life for older adults with serious illness, spanning not only the functional aspects of symptom and medication management, but the affective aspects of suffering.</description>

      <title>Health Ministry</title>

      <description>Culture plays an important role in health promotion interventions, and there has been an increasing use of community-based settings for health promotion activities. Church membership provides a strong foundation for social support, regular face-to-face meetings that represent additional channels for intervention, authority figures (clergy) who can be appealed to in health messaging, and a shared belief system that can be leveraged in motivating behavior change. Many churches also have a group of highly-engaged volunteers who run &amp;ldquo;Health Ministries&amp;rdquo;, responsible for promoting the health of the congregation and the broader community, and represent additional resources for health interventions.</description>

      <title>Family Health History</title>

      <description>A family health history - incorporating a &amp;ldquo;family tree&amp;rdquo; along with health conditions for each family member - can significantly improve disease risk assessments, even when all available genetic tests have been done. The family history is crucially important for determining risk for many chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer, and represents an integration of disease risk stemming from genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors. Despite this, most health providers do a poor job of collecting family health histories, if they do it at all.</description>

      <title>Preconception Care</title>
      <link>https://relationalagents.com/project/preconception-care/</link>

      <description>Despite increased access to prenatal care, the United States continues to rank poorly worldwide in birth outcomes. Intervention studies delivering timely, comprehensive and expanded prenatal care have not been shown to improve persistent disparities in birth outcomes. Thus, prenatal care is too little too late.
The purpose of this project is to develop a relational agent who supports women in improving their personal preconception risks in order to improve their preconception health status and improve their chances of having a healthy pregnancy and healthy baby.</description>

      <title>Preconception Care for Males (Gabe)</title>
      <link>https://relationalagents.com/project/male-preconception-care/</link>

      <description>The preconception care system for men (Gabe) involves the developement and deployment of a software application that delivers a health and wellness intervention to young African American men. At the heart of the system is an Relational Agent that has conversations with the users, both to understand which health issues they are at risk for and to discuss potential solutions to those problems.
We use an agent to deliver the content in an engaging way, which has the potential to increase long-term user retention.</description>

      <description>When deployed on smartphones, virtual agents have the potential to deliver life-saving advice regarding emergency medical conditions, as well as provide a convenient channel for health education to help improve the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy. This paper describes the use of a smartphonebased virtual agent that provides counseling to patients with Atrial Fibrillation, along with the results from a pilot acceptance study among patients with the condition. Atrial Fibrillation is a highly prevalent heart rhythm disorder and is known to significantly increase the risk of stroke, heart failure and death.</description>

      <title>Alcohol Treatment for Veterans</title>

      <description>The purpose of this project is to develop and evaluate an animated conversational agent that will talk to patients about their alcohol and substance use while waiting to see their primary care physician. The goal of the project is to inspire users to make healthy behavior change, regarding their alcohol consumption, through counseling.</description>

      <title>Spinal Cord Injury</title>

      <description>Most persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) require training and support for self-care management to help prevent the development of serious secondary conditions after hospital discharge. However, adherence to self-care management behaviors is poor once training with a therapist has ended.
We have designed a virtual coach system, in which a relational agent engages individuals with SCI in simulated face-to-face conversations at home, to provide support and motivate adherence to self-care guidelines.</description>

      <title>Couples Counseler Robot</title>

      <description>Several conversational agents and robots have been developed to simulate one-on-one health counseling sessions and have been shown to be effective. However only a few of these have been designed to interact with multiple co-located users at a given time. The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a robot to conduct couples counseling, focusing initially on promoting positive communication behavior. In order for the robot to be successful, it needs to both support basic multiparty conversational processes (such as turn-taking and interruptions), and model couples counseling techniques.</description>

      <title>Public Speaking Coach</title>

      <description>Rehearsing in front of a live audience is a common practice when preparing for important presentations. However, not everyone has the opportunity to do this, due to time constraints, availability of listeners who can provide constructive feedback, or public speaking anxiety. RoboCOP is a fully-automated anthropomorphic robot that acts as a coach to provide feedback during presentation rehearsals at both the individual slide and overall presentation level. The robot offers conversational coaching on three key aspects of presentations: speech quality, content coverage and eye contact.</description>

      <description>The quality of most professional oral presentations is often poor, owing to a number of factors, including public speaking anxiety. DynamicDuo is a system that uses an automated, life-sized, animated agent to help inexperienced speakers deliver their presentations in front of an audience. The design of the system was informed by an analysis of talks given by two human presenters to identify the most common dual-presentation formats and transition behaviors used.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression</title>
      <link>https://relationalagents.com/project/cbt-for-depression/</link>

      <description>Depression is one of the leading causes of disability in the world, effecting more than 350 million people. Unlike other treatable epidemics that affect our society. However, less than half of those suffering receive treatment. To address this issue, several automated computer-based cognitive behavioral therapy systems have been developed that enable patients to receive therapeutic care at home. While effective, these automated interventions are still inferior to traditional face-to-face therapy sessions with human counselors, due to poor retention and lack of interactivity and adaptability.</description>
