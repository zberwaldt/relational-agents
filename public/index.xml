The resulting agents are capable of continuous, always on, operation, with persistent social and relational goals, enabling them to proactively provide support. The agents will be evaluated in a series of longitudinal studies in which several virtual and robotic agents are installed in the homes of older adults.</description></item><item><title>Palliative Care Agent</title><link>https://relationalagents.com/project/palliative-care-agent/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relationalagents.com/project/palliative-care-agent/</guid><description>The purpose of this project is to develop a conversational agent system that counsels terminally ill patients in order to alleviate their suffering and improve their quality of life.
Although many interventions have now been developed to address palliative care for specific chronic diseases, little has been done to address the overall quality of life for older adults with serious illness, spanning not only the functional aspects of symptom and medication management, but the affective aspects of suffering.</description></item><item><title>Breastfeeding Promotion</title><link>https://relationalagents.com/project/archive/breastfeeding-promotion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relationalagents.com/project/archive/breastfeeding-promotion/</guid><description>Despite recommendations from the CDC and several professional health organizations that infants be exclusively breastfed for the first six months, only 14.8% of mothers in the U.S. adhere to these guidelines.
The purpose of this project is to develop a relational agent that promotes breastfeeding among new mothers. The agent interacts with mothers during their third trimester to boost motivation, bedside in the hospital maternity ward to provide information on breastfeeding basics, and at home for six months to provide continued assistance.</description></item><item><title>Health Ministry</title><link>https://relationalagents.com/project/health-ministry/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relationalagents.com/project/health-ministry/</guid><description>Culture plays an important role in health promotion interventions, and there has been an increasing use of community-based settings for health promotion activities. Church membership provides a strong foundation for social support, regular face-to-face meetings that represent additional channels for intervention, authority figures (clergy) who can be appealed to in health messaging, and a shared belief system that can be leveraged in motivating behavior change. Many churches also have a group of highly-engaged volunteers who run &amp;ldquo;Health Ministries&amp;rdquo;, responsible for promoting the health of the congregation and the broader community, and represent additional resources for health interventions.</description></item><item><title>Family Health History</title><link>https://relationalagents.com/project/family-history/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relationalagents.com/project/family-history/</guid><description>A family health history - incorporating a &amp;ldquo;family tree&amp;rdquo; along with health conditions for each family member - can significantly improve disease risk assessments, even when all available genetic tests have been done. The family history is crucially important for determining risk for many chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer, and represents an integration of disease risk stemming from genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors. Despite this, most health providers do a poor job of collecting family health histories, if they do it at all.</description></item><item><title>Just-in-Time Information for Exercise Adoption</title><link>https://relationalagents.com/project/archive/mobile-agent/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relationalagents.com/project/archive/mobile-agent/</guid><description>What happens if you put an exercise coach on a wearable computer? What if the coach could actually sense whether you were doing your exercise or not? And, what if the coach were designed to get to know you, your personal likes and dislikes, and something about your life plans?
This project explores these questions through the development and evaluation of an innovative automated portable exercise advisor system. The system incorporates a PDA, a motion sensor (accelerometer), and a relational agent, and is designed to interact with people over extended periods of time to set and follow up on daily exercise goals.</description></item><item><title>A RCT to Reduce Cardiopulmonary Re-hospitalizations</title><link>https://relationalagents.com/project/archive/virtual-nurse/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relationalagents.com/project/archive/virtual-nurse/</guid><description>This five-year, NIH/NHLBI-funded project, in collaboration with Boston Medical Center, has developed procedures and technologies for educating hospital patients about their conditions and post-discharge self-care, medications, and follow-up appointments, in an effort to reduce re-hospitalizations due to poor patient communication and patient non-compliance. We have developed a conversational virtual nurse agent that conducts a bedside dialogue with patients immediately prior to hospital discharge. This intervention was compared with a standard-of-care control condition in a randomized clinical trial involving 750 patients being discharged from Boston Medical Center.</description></item><item><title>Preconception Care</title><link>https://relationalagents.com/project/preconception-care/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relationalagents.com/project/preconception-care/</guid><description>Despite increased access to prenatal care, the United States continues to rank poorly worldwide in birth outcomes. Intervention studies delivering timely, comprehensive and expanded prenatal care have not been shown to improve persistent disparities in birth outcomes. Thus, prenatal care is too little too late.
The purpose of this project is to develop a relational agent who supports women in improving their personal preconception risks in order to improve their preconception health status and improve their chances of having a healthy pregnancy and healthy baby.</description></item><item><title>Computer Agents to Promote Walking in Older Adults with Low Health Literacy</title><link>https://relationalagents.com/project/archive/senior-exercise-agent/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relationalagents.com/project/archive/senior-exercise-agent/</guid><description>Relational Agents represent an especially effective modality for educating and motivating older adults and other individuals with low reading, health or computer literacy, given the agents&amp;rsquo; intuitive emulation of face-to-face conversation and the engagement and social bonding afforded by their use of relational behavior such as social dialog, empathy and humor.
In a recently completed pilot study, participants recruited from the Geriatric Ambulatory Practice at Boston Medical Center who used a Relational Agent exercise coach daily for two months performed significantly more walking compared to a non-intervention control group drawn from the same practice.</description></item><item><title>Preconception Care for Males (Gabe)</title><link>https://relationalagents.com/project/male-preconception-care/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relationalagents.com/project/male-preconception-care/</guid><description>The preconception care system for men (Gabe) involves the developement and deployment of a software application that delivers a health and wellness intervention to young African American men. At the heart of the system is an Relational Agent that has conversations with the users, both to understand which health issues they are at risk for and to discuss potential solutions to those problems.
We use an agent to deliver the content in an engaging way, which has the potential to increase long-term user retention.</description></item><item><title>A Virtual Laboratory for Studying Long-Term Human-Computer Relationships</title><link>https://relationalagents.com/project/archive/virtual-laboratory/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relationalagents.com/project/archive/virtual-laboratory/</guid><description>The objective of this five-year project, funded through an NSF CAREER grant, is to study how social interface agents can conduct very long-term interactions with users spanning months or years of daily use and the impacts these interactions can have on user education, behavior change and overall well-being. A secondary objective is the development of a networked software architecture and experimental methodology to support very long-term human-computer interaction studies, in which new experiments and agent capabilities can be dynamically integrated into a running system serving a persistent group of human subjects.</description></item><item><title>Atrial Fibrillation</title><link>https://relationalagents.com/project/atrial-fibrillation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relationalagents.com/project/atrial-fibrillation/</guid><description>When deployed on smartphones, virtual agents have the potential to deliver life-saving advice regarding emergency medical conditions, as well as provide a convenient channel for health education to help improve the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy. This paper describes the use of a smartphonebased virtual agent that provides counseling to patients with Atrial Fibrillation, along with the results from a pilot acceptance study among patients with the condition. Atrial Fibrillation is a highly prevalent heart rhythm disorder and is known to significantly increase the risk of stroke, heart failure and death.</description></item><item><title>Alcohol Treatment for Veterans</title><link>https://relationalagents.com/project/alcohol-treatment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relationalagents.com/project/alcohol-treatment/</guid><description>The purpose of this project is to develop and evaluate an animated conversational agent that will talk to patients about their alcohol and substance use while waiting to see their primary care physician. The goal of the project is to inspire users to make healthy behavior change, regarding their alcohol consumption, through counseling.</description></item><item><title>Computational Models of Health Behavior Change Dialog</title><link>https://relationalagents.com/project/archive/ontology-driven-dialogue/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relationalagents.com/project/archive/ontology-driven-dialogue/</guid><description>The development of ontologies for behavioral medicine is decades behind that for biomedical ontologies, even though behavioral factors such as smoking, diet and physical inactivity are the primary determinants of half of the Healthy People 2010 Leading Health Indicators. In this collaborative effort involving Prof. Timothy Bickmore, Prof. Kenneth Baclawski, Dr. Candace Sidner, Prof. Abby King (Stanford University), and clinical psychologists, we are developing an ontology of concepts and a task model that are relevant to health behavior change, and that can be used to directly drive a health counseling dialog planner.</description></item><item><title>Drugs don&#39;t work in patients who don&#39;t take them C. Everett Koop, MD</title><link>https://relationalagents.com/project/archive/medication-adherence/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relationalagents.com/project/archive/medication-adherence/</guid><description>Patients only follow prescribed medication regimens about half of the time, leading to 125,000 deaths annually in the US. We have developed a home-based relational agent designed to promote antipsychotic medication adherence among patients with schizophrenia. The agent tracks each patient&amp;rsquo;s medication taking behavior for a single antipsychotic taken by mouth in pill or capsule form based on self-report, but she also reminds patients to take all of their other medications as prescribed.</description></item><item><title>Spinal Cord Injury</title><link>https://relationalagents.com/project/spinal-cord-injury/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relationalagents.com/project/spinal-cord-injury/</guid><description>Most persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) require training and support for self-care management to help prevent the development of serious secondary conditions after hospital discharge. However, adherence to self-care management behaviors is poor once training with a therapist has ended.
We have designed a virtual coach system, in which a relational agent engages individuals with SCI in simulated face-to-face conversations at home, to provide support and motivate adherence to self-care guidelines.</description></item><item><title>A Virtual Coach to Increase Physical Activity in Overweight Adults</title><link>https://relationalagents.com/project/archive/weight-loss-agent/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relationalagents.com/project/archive/weight-loss-agent/</guid><description>Over two-thirds of Americans are currently overweight or obese. Poor adherence to recommended levels of exercise is a major contributory factor. The goal of this study is to integrate a wearable activity monitor from FitSense with a home-computer-based relational agent to provide daily physical activity counseling for overweight adults.
We conducted a randomized trial involving 70 overweight adults over a 12 week intervention period. All participants were asked to wear a FitSense ActiPed to track activity and were provided access to a website to view their personal step counts and activity level.</description></item><item><title>Couples Counseler Robot</title><link>https://relationalagents.com/project/couples-counseling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relationalagents.com/project/couples-counseling/</guid><description>Several conversational agents and robots have been developed to simulate one-on-one health counseling sessions and have been shown to be effective. However only a few of these have been designed to interact with multiple co-located users at a given time. The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a robot to conduct couples counseling, focusing initially on promoting positive communication behavior. In order for the robot to be successful, it needs to both support basic multiparty conversational processes (such as turn-taking and interruptions), and model couples counseling techniques.</description></item><item><title>Online Tailored Interventions &amp; Relational Agents for Exercise and Sun Protection (Project RAISE)</title><link>https://relationalagents.com/project/archive/multi-behavior-agent/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relationalagents.com/project/archive/multi-behavior-agent/</guid><description>The purpose of this project is to develop a relational agent that is used in conjunction with a year-long, web-based intervention for physical activity promotion and ultraviolet radiation avoidance for cancer prevention. The relational agent will act as a guide for the website and will be evaluated in a randomized clinical trial involving a national sample of 1,600 study participants.
This five-year effort is being performed in collaboration with the University of Rhode Island Cancer Prevention Research Center and ProChange Behavior Systems, Inc.</description></item><item><title>Public Speaking Coach</title><link>https://relationalagents.com/project/public-speaking-coach/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relationalagents.com/project/public-speaking-coach/</guid><description>Rehearsing in front of a live audience is a common practice when preparing for important presentations. However, not everyone has the opportunity to do this, due to time constraints, availability of listeners who can provide constructive feedback, or public speaking anxiety. RoboCOP is a fully-automated anthropomorphic robot that acts as a coach to provide feedback during presentation rehearsals at both the individual slide and overall presentation level. The robot offers conversational coaching on three key aspects of presentations: speech quality, content coverage and eye contact.</description></item><item><title>Co-presenter Agent</title><link>https://relationalagents.com/project/co-presenter-agent/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relationalagents.com/project/co-presenter-agent/</guid><description>The quality of most professional oral presentations is often poor, owing to a number of factors, including public speaking anxiety. DynamicDuo is a system that uses an automated, life-sized, animated agent to help inexperienced speakers deliver their presentations in front of an audience. The design of the system was informed by an analysis of talks given by two human presenters to identify the most common dual-presentation formats and transition behaviors used.</description></item><item><title>Tinker: A Relational Guide for the Boston Museum of Science</title><link>https://relationalagents.com/project/archive/museum-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relationalagents.com/project/archive/museum-guide/</guid><description>People go to museums as much to be entertained and to socialize as they do to be educated. Contemporary museums use interactive exhibits, multimedia, games, automated mobile guides, and other mechanisms for entertaining individuals and groups of visitors. The incorporation of principles from the social psychology of human personal relationships represents a promising and important direction of research to further engage and entertain museum visitors.
In this project, we have developed a virtual museum guide agent named &amp;ldquo;Tinker&amp;rdquo; that uses human relationship-building behaviors to engage museum visitors.</description></item><item><title>Automated Comforting by Relational Agents</title><link>https://relationalagents.com/project/archive/comforting-agents/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relationalagents.com/project/archive/comforting-agents/</guid><description>Comforting is an important component of emotional and social support and the development of personal relationships, and can be important in its own right in healthcare applications. Social support has also been demonstrated in many studies to have a significant positive impact on health. We are conducting an on-going series of experiments to evaluate the ability of a relational agent to comfort users in stressful situations.</description></item><item><title>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression</title><link>https://relationalagents.com/project/cbt-for-depression/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relationalagents.com/project/cbt-for-depression/</guid><description>Depression is one of the leading causes of disability in the world, effecting more than 350 million people. Unlike other treatable epidemics that affect our society. However, less than half of those suffering receive treatment. To address this issue, several automated computer-based cognitive behavioral therapy systems have been developed that enable patients to receive therapeutic care at home. While effective, these automated interventions are still inferior to traditional face-to-face therapy sessions with human counselors, due to poor retention and lack of interactivity and adaptability.</description></item><item><title>Pre-Surgery Counseling by Relational Agent</title><link>https://relationalagents.com/project/archive/surgery-preparation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relationalagents.com/project/archive/surgery-preparation/</guid><description>Patients are often poorly informed about their options for surgery, such as alternatives for anesthesia, and often arrive at the hospital improperly prepared for their procedure.
In collaboration with the Dept. of Anesthesiology at Massachusetts General Hospital, we have developed a relational agent to counsel patients on their options for anesthesia, including the risks and benefits of each, what to expect before, during, and after surgery, and how to prepare before coming to the hospital.</description></item><item><title>Research Ethics and Safety Promoted by Embodied Conversational Technology (RESPECT)</title><link>https://relationalagents.com/project/archive/clinical-trial-explanation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relationalagents.com/project/archive/clinical-trial-explanation/</guid><description>Despite decades of advocacy to improve informed consent for human subjects, multiple studies have shown that research subjects often do not understand fundamental concepts required for participation. In this project we are advancing our research toward the development of a scalable, cost-effective, and sustainable patient-centered intervention to make it easier for people to search for research studies, improve the quality of informed consent, improve adherence to research protocols, and promote better reporting of adverse events.</description></item><item><title>Health Document Explanation by Relational Agents</title><link>https://relationalagents.com/project/archive/document-explanation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relationalagents.com/project/archive/document-explanation/</guid><description>Many professionals provide their lay clients with documents that are, to varying degrees, incomprehensible. Whether due to technical jargon, obscure concepts, or poor writing on the part of the professional, or low literacy, cultural barriers, or cognitive impairment on the part of the client, documents often fail to serve their intended communicative function. Perhaps nowhere is this problem more important and pervasive than in healthcare. The consequences of a patient failing to understand a prescription, hospital discharge instructions, or pre-surgery instructions can have serious, even fatal, consequences.</description></item><item><title>Computer-Based Physical Activity Advice for Ethnic Minority Aging Adults</title><link>https://relationalagents.com/project/archive/latino-exercise-promotion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relationalagents.com/project/archive/latino-exercise-promotion/</guid><description>The purpose of this project is to develop and evaluate a Spanish-speaking relational agent that plays the role of an exercise coach to promote physical activity among older English and Spanish-speaking Latino adults. The focus of the effort is on the linguistic and cultural adaptation required to develop an effective automated health counselor that is able to relate to, advise, and socialize with midlife and older Latino adults living in a low-income, under-served Eastside area of San Jose, CA.</description></item><item><title>Dtask</title><link>https://relationalagents.com/demo/dtask/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relationalagents.com/demo/dtask/</guid><description>DTask: A hierarchical task decomposition-based dialogue planner DTask is a dialogue planner designed to model and execute system-directed dialogue, with multiple-choice user input. Dialogue is specified declaratively, as a hierarchical task decomposition. It is designed to model and execute system-directed dialogue, where user input is performed via selection from a multiple choice menu of possible utterances, dynamically updated at each turn of the dialogue. DTask uses a CEA-2018 recipe library to plan a task decomposition for each segment of a dialogue.</description></item><item><title>LiteBody: Installation Guide</title><link>https://relationalagents.com/demo/litebody/installation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://relationalagents.com/demo/litebody/installation/</guid><description>LiteBody: Installation, Configuration and Deployment Guide The following document is a brief description of how to configure and deploy litebody along with its dialogue manager.
