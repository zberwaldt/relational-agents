      <guid>https://zberwaldt.github.io/relational-agents/project/archive/eldercare-agent/</guid>
      <description>The purpose of this project is the creation of intelligent virtual and robotic agents capable of providing social, instrumental, and social network support to older adults living alone. The resulting agents are capable of continuous, always on, operation, with persistent social and relational goals, enabling them to proactively provide support. The agents will be evaluated in a series of longitudinal studies in which several virtual and robotic agents are installed in the homes of older adults.</description>

      <guid>https://zberwaldt.github.io/relational-agents/project/palliative-care-agent/</guid>
      <description>The purpose of this project is to develop a conversational agent system that counsels terminally ill patients in order to alleviate their suffering and improve their quality of life.
Although many interventions have now been developed to address palliative care for specific chronic diseases, little has been done to address the overall quality of life for older adults with serious illness, spanning not only the functional aspects of symptom and medication management, but the affective aspects of suffering.</description>

      <guid>https://zberwaldt.github.io/relational-agents/project/archive/breastfeeding-promotion/</guid>
      <description>Despite recommendations from the CDC and several professional health organizations that infants be exclusively breastfed for the first six months, only 14.8% of mothers in the U.S. adhere to these guidelines.
The purpose of this project is to develop a relational agent that promotes breastfeeding among new mothers. The agent interacts with mothers during their third trimester to boost motivation, bedside in the hospital maternity ward to provide information on breastfeeding basics, and at home for six months to provide continued assistance.</description>

      <description>Culture plays an important role in health promotion interventions, and there has been an increasing use of community-based settings for health promotion activities. Church membership provides a strong foundation for social support, regular face-to-face meetings that represent additional channels for intervention, authority figures (clergy) who can be appealed to in health messaging, and a shared belief system that can be leveraged in motivating behavior change. Many churches also have a group of highly-engaged volunteers who run &amp;ldquo;Health Ministries&amp;rdquo;, responsible for promoting the health of the congregation and the broader community, and represent additional resources for health interventions.</description>

      <description>A family health history - incorporating a &amp;ldquo;family tree&amp;rdquo; along with health conditions for each family member - can significantly improve disease risk assessments, even when all available genetic tests have been done. The family history is crucially important for determining risk for many chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer, and represents an integration of disease risk stemming from genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors. Despite this, most health providers do a poor job of collecting family health histories, if they do it at all.</description>

      <guid>https://zberwaldt.github.io/relational-agents/project/archive/mobile-agent/</guid>
      <description>What happens if you put an exercise coach on a wearable computer? What if the coach could actually sense whether you were doing your exercise or not? And, what if the coach were designed to get to know you, your personal likes and dislikes, and something about your life plans?
This project explores these questions through the development and evaluation of an innovative automated portable exercise advisor system. The system incorporates a PDA, a motion sensor (accelerometer), and a relational agent, and is designed to interact with people over extended periods of time to set and follow up on daily exercise goals.</description>

      <guid>https://zberwaldt.github.io/relational-agents/project/archive/virtual-nurse/</guid>
      <description>This five-year, NIH/NHLBI-funded project, in collaboration with Boston Medical Center, has developed procedures and technologies for educating hospital patients about their conditions and post-discharge self-care, medications, and follow-up appointments, in an effort to reduce re-hospitalizations due to poor patient communication and patient non-compliance. We have developed a conversational virtual nurse agent that conducts a bedside dialogue with patients immediately prior to hospital discharge. This intervention was compared with a standard-of-care control condition in a randomized clinical trial involving 750 patients being discharged from Boston Medical Center.</description>

      <guid>https://zberwaldt.github.io/relational-agents/project/preconception-care/</guid>
      <description>Despite increased access to prenatal care, the United States continues to rank poorly worldwide in birth outcomes. Intervention studies delivering timely, comprehensive and expanded prenatal care have not been shown to improve persistent disparities in birth outcomes. Thus, prenatal care is too little too late.
The purpose of this project is to develop a relational agent who supports women in improving their personal preconception risks in order to improve their preconception health status and improve their chances of having a healthy pregnancy and healthy baby.</description>

      <guid>https://zberwaldt.github.io/relational-agents/project/archive/senior-exercise-agent/</guid>
      <description>Relational Agents represent an especially effective modality for educating and motivating older adults and other individuals with low reading, health or computer literacy, given the agents&amp;rsquo; intuitive emulation of face-to-face conversation and the engagement and social bonding afforded by their use of relational behavior such as social dialog, empathy and humor.
In a recently completed pilot study, participants recruited from the Geriatric Ambulatory Practice at Boston Medical Center who used a Relational Agent exercise coach daily for two months performed significantly more walking compared to a non-intervention control group drawn from the same practice.</description>

      <description>The preconception care system for men (Gabe) involves the developement and deployment of a software application that delivers a health and wellness intervention to young African American men. At the heart of the system is an Relational Agent that has conversations with the users, both to understand which health issues they are at risk for and to discuss potential solutions to those problems.
We use an agent to deliver the content in an engaging way, which has the potential to increase long-term user retention.</description>

      <description>When deployed on smartphones, virtual agents have the potential to deliver life-saving advice regarding emergency medical conditions, as well as provide a convenient channel for health education to help improve the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy. This paper describes the use of a smartphonebased virtual agent that provides counseling to patients with Atrial Fibrillation, along with the results from a pilot acceptance study among patients with the condition. Atrial Fibrillation is a highly prevalent heart rhythm disorder and is known to significantly increase the risk of stroke, heart failure and death.</description>

      <description>The development of ontologies for behavioral medicine is decades behind that for biomedical ontologies, even though behavioral factors such as smoking, diet and physical inactivity are the primary determinants of half of the Healthy People 2010 Leading Health Indicators. In this collaborative effort involving Prof. Timothy Bickmore, Prof. Kenneth Baclawski, Dr. Candace Sidner, Prof. Abby King (Stanford University), and clinical psychologists, we are developing an ontology of concepts and a task model that are relevant to health behavior change, and that can be used to directly drive a health counseling dialog planner.</description>

      <description>Patients only follow prescribed medication regimens about half of the time, leading to 125,000 deaths annually in the US. We have developed a home-based relational agent designed to promote antipsychotic medication adherence among patients with schizophrenia. The agent tracks each patient&amp;rsquo;s medication taking behavior for a single antipsychotic taken by mouth in pill or capsule form based on self-report, but she also reminds patients to take all of their other medications as prescribed.</description>

      <description>Most persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) require training and support for self-care management to help prevent the development of serious secondary conditions after hospital discharge. However, adherence to self-care management behaviors is poor once training with a therapist has ended.
We have designed a virtual coach system, in which a relational agent engages individuals with SCI in simulated face-to-face conversations at home, to provide support and motivate adherence to self-care guidelines.</description>

      <description>Over two-thirds of Americans are currently overweight or obese. Poor adherence to recommended levels of exercise is a major contributory factor. The goal of this study is to integrate a wearable activity monitor from FitSense with a home-computer-based relational agent to provide daily physical activity counseling for overweight adults.
We conducted a randomized trial involving 70 overweight adults over a 12 week intervention period. All participants were asked to wear a FitSense ActiPed to track activity and were provided access to a website to view their personal step counts and activity level.</description>

      <description>Several conversational agents and robots have been developed to simulate one-on-one health counseling sessions and have been shown to be effective. However only a few of these have been designed to interact with multiple co-located users at a given time. The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a robot to conduct couples counseling, focusing initially on promoting positive communication behavior. In order for the robot to be successful, it needs to both support basic multiparty conversational processes (such as turn-taking and interruptions), and model couples counseling techniques.</description>

      <description>Rehearsing in front of a live audience is a common practice when preparing for important presentations. However, not everyone has the opportunity to do this, due to time constraints, availability of listeners who can provide constructive feedback, or public speaking anxiety. RoboCOP is a fully-automated anthropomorphic robot that acts as a coach to provide feedback during presentation rehearsals at both the individual slide and overall presentation level. The robot offers conversational coaching on three key aspects of presentations: speech quality, content coverage and eye contact.</description>

      <guid>https://zberwaldt.github.io/relational-agents/project/archive/museum-guide/</guid>
      <description>People go to museums as much to be entertained and to socialize as they do to be educated. Contemporary museums use interactive exhibits, multimedia, games, automated mobile guides, and other mechanisms for entertaining individuals and groups of visitors. The incorporation of principles from the social psychology of human personal relationships represents a promising and important direction of research to further engage and entertain museum visitors.
In this project, we have developed a virtual museum guide agent named &amp;ldquo;Tinker&amp;rdquo; that uses human relationship-building behaviors to engage museum visitors.</description>

      <description>Depression is one of the leading causes of disability in the world, effecting more than 350 million people. Unlike other treatable epidemics that affect our society. However, less than half of those suffering receive treatment. To address this issue, several automated computer-based cognitive behavioral therapy systems have been developed that enable patients to receive therapeutic care at home. While effective, these automated interventions are still inferior to traditional face-to-face therapy sessions with human counselors, due to poor retention and lack of interactivity and adaptability.</description>

      <description>Patients are often poorly informed about their options for surgery, such as alternatives for anesthesia, and often arrive at the hospital improperly prepared for their procedure.
In collaboration with the Dept. of Anesthesiology at Massachusetts General Hospital, we have developed a relational agent to counsel patients on their options for anesthesia, including the risks and benefits of each, what to expect before, during, and after surgery, and how to prepare before coming to the hospital.</description>

      <description>Many professionals provide their lay clients with documents that are, to varying degrees, incomprehensible. Whether due to technical jargon, obscure concepts, or poor writing on the part of the professional, or low literacy, cultural barriers, or cognitive impairment on the part of the client, documents often fail to serve their intended communicative function. Perhaps nowhere is this problem more important and pervasive than in healthcare. The consequences of a patient failing to understand a prescription, hospital discharge instructions, or pre-surgery instructions can have serious, even fatal, consequences.</description>

Dialogue is specified declaratively, as a hierarchical task decomposition. It is designed to model and execute system-directed dialogue, where user input is performed via selection from a multiple choice menu of possible utterances, dynamically updated at each turn of the dialogue. DTask uses a CEA-2018 recipe library to plan a task decomposition for each segment of a dialogue.</description>

      <description>LiteBody: Client-Server Communication Protocol The server is deployed at a URL that is known to the client: the agent URL. Messages sent to this URL either request information about the agent as a whole, or request a new conversation.
Each conversation is assigned a conversation URL by the server. To carry on a conversation once started, the client sends messages to the conversation URL.
All messages sent by the client may include parameters in a key-value form, passed in as for an HTML form:</description>

      <description>HBCO: Open Source Ontology and Task Models for Deploying Health Behavior Change Dialogue Systems The Health Behavior Change Ontology (HBCO) is an ontology, knowledge base, and set of task models that can be used to drive health behavior change counseling systems. The system models the theory-driven therapeutic planning processes of a human health advisor during a counseling session, and is designed to be reusable. To address issues of reuse, we have built the system on public standard formalisms for computerized ontologies (OWL and RDF) and hierarchical task models (ANSI/CEA-2018).</description>
