Dialogue is specified declaratively, as a hierarchical task decomposition. It is designed to model and execute system-directed dialogue, where user input is performed via selection from a multiple choice menu of possible utterances, dynamically updated at each turn of the dialogue. DTask uses a CEA-2018 recipe library to plan a task decomposition for each segment of a dialogue.</description></item><item><title>hbco</title><link>https://zberwaldt.github.io/relational-agents/demo/hbco/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zberwaldt.github.io/relational-agents/demo/hbco/</guid><description>HBCO: Open Source Ontology and Task Models for Deploying Health Behavior Change Dialogue Systems The Health Behavior Change Ontology (HBCO) is an ontology, knowledge base, and set of task models that can be used to drive health behavior change counseling systems. The system models the theory-driven therapeutic planning processes of a human health advisor during a counseling session, and is designed to be reusable. To address issues of reuse, we have built the system on public standard formalisms for computerized ontologies (OWL and RDF) and hierarchical task models (ANSI/CEA-2018).</description></item></channel></rss>
