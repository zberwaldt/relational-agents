The purpose of this project is to develop and evaluate a Spanish-speaking relational agent that plays the role of an exercise coach to promote physical activity among older English and Spanish-speaking Latino adults. The focus of the effort is on the linguistic and cultural adaptation required to develop an effective automated health counselor that is able to relate to, advise, and socialize with midlife and older Latino adults living in a low-income, under-served Eastside area of San Jose, CA.

This effort is in collaboration with Prof. Abby King at the Stanford Prevention Research Center and is funded by the NIH National Cancer Institute.
