Despite  decades of advocacy to improve informed consent for human subjects, multiple  studies have shown that research subjects often do not understand fundamental  concepts required for participation. In  this project we are advancing our research toward the development of a scalable,  cost-effective, and sustainable patient-centered intervention to make it easier  for people to search for research studies, improve the quality of informed  consent, improve adherence to research protocols, and promote better reporting  of adverse events.

This work is in collaboration with Dr. Michael Paasche-Orlow at Boston Medical Center, and funded by the National Cancer Institute (R01CA158219).
