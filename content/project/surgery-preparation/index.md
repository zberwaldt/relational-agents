Patients are often poorly informed about their options for surgery, such as alternatives for anesthesia, and often arrive at the hospital improperly prepared for their procedure.

In collaboration with the Dept. of Anesthesiology at    Massachusetts General Hospital, we have developed a relational agent  to counsel patients on their options for anesthesia, including the risks and befits of each, what to expect before, during, and after surgery, and how to prepare before coming to the hospital. The counseling content is tailored for each patient by an anesthetist, and unresolved questions and issues raised during the session are printed out for follow up with the anesthetist after the agent counseling session. The system is currently undergoing clincial trial with 150 patients, evaluating impact of the agent on patient readiness for surgery and satisfaction, compared to standard care.
