The purpose of this project is to develop a conversational agent
system that counsels terminally ill patients in order to alleviate
their suffering and improve their quality of life.

Although many interventions have now been developed to address
palliative care for specific chronic diseases, little has been done to
address the overall quality of life for older adults with serious
illness, spanning not only the functional aspects of symptom and
medication management, but the affective aspects of suffering. In this
project, we are developing a relational agent to counsel patients at
home about medication adherence, stress management, advanced care
planning, and spiritual support, and to provide referrals to palliative
care services when needed.
