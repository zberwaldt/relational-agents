Several conversational agents and robots have been developed to simulate one-on-one health counseling sessions and have been shown to be effective.
However only a few of these have been designed to interact with multiple co-located users at a given time.
The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a robot to conduct  couples counseling, focusing
initially on promoting positive communication behavior.
In order for the robot to be successful, it needs to both support basic multiparty conversational processes (such as turn-taking and interruptions), and
model couples counseling techniques.
We are evaluating the efficacy of the robot in facilitating group interaction (process outcomes) and improving
couples' communication skills and relationship quality.
