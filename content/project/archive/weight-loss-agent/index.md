Over two-thirds of Americans are currently overweight or obese. Poor adherence to recommended levels of exercise is a major contributory factor. The goal of this study is to integrate a wearable activity monitor from [FitSense](http://www.fitlinxx.com/brand.htm) with a home-computer-based relational agent to provide daily physical activity counseling for overweight adults.

We conducted a randomized trial involving 70 overweight adults over a 12 week intervention period. All participants were asked to wear a [FitSense ActiPed](http://www.fitlinxx.com/products_list-pub.html) to track activity  and were provided access to a website to view their personal step counts and activity level. Intervention participants were additionally asked to meet three times per week with a relational agent coach on their home computers. There was a significant decline in mean daily step count of 1025 between the first three weeks and the final three weeks of the study in control subjects (p=0.011).  In contrast step count in the intervention group was maintained over the 12 weeks of the study.

This project was funded by and performed in collaboration with [Partners Center for Connected Health](http://www.connected-health.org/).
