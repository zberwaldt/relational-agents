The purpose of this project is to develop a relational agent that is used in conjunction with a year-long, web-based intervention for physical activity promotion and ultraviolet radiation avoidance for cancer prevention. The relational agent will act as a guide for the website and will be evaluated in a randomized clinical trial involving a national sample of 1,600 study participants.

This five-year effort is being performed in collaboration with the [University of Rhode Island Cancer Prevention Research Center](http://www.uri.edu/research/cprc/) and [ProChange Behavior Systems, Inc.](http://www.prochange.com/), and is funded by the NIH National Cancer Institute.
