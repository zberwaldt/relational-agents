    bio: "I am a Professor in the College of Computer and Information Science at Northeastern.
    My research focus is on the development of Relational Agents, especially in the area of health counseling applications.
    Prior to joining Northeastern, I was an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Boston University School of Medicine.
    I received my PhD from the MIT Media Lab, studying under Profs. Rosalind Picard (Affective Computing) and Justine Cassell (Gesture and Narrative Language)."

    bio: "I joined the Relational Agents group as a postdoctoral researcher in January 2014. I received my Ph.D. at the University of Dundee (UK), supervised by Prof. Annalu Waller, Prof. Vicki Hanson, and Prof. Ehud Reiter. My primary research interest lies in the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). More specifically, I am interested in exploring how HCI and NLP methods can be employed to provide effective communication support for individuals with diverse language, speech, physical and cognitive abilities. My current research is focused on automatic generation of social dialogue as a means of promoting user engagement with embodied conversational agents."

    bio: "My foray into research in HCI began when I first joined the group as a Master's student in May'17. I worked on building technologies that use virtual animated characters for healthcare interventions and reducing public speaking anxiety while giving presentations. This put me in a good stead and motivated me to apply for the PhD program here at Northeastern. I once again joined the group, this time as a PhD student, in fall '18. With the breakneck speed at which Artificial Intelligence (AI) is evolving, the impact it is set to have is unprecedented. Its pervasiveness has led it to be touted as the ‘new electricity’. While AI’s influence is bound to reach far and wide, I believe it is healthcare that will reap the most benefits from AI in the near future. Thus, the opportunities in the healthcare field - in diagnosis, patient experience, care coordination- and the challenges in making them a reality excite me, from both a technological and societal standpoint."

    bio: "I joined the Relational Agents Group as a PhD student in Computer Science in September 2013. I received my B.S in Information Technology from Sharif University of Technology (Iran).
    My primary research interest is in Human Computer Interaction.
    In particular, I am interested in the role of computer agents in human life and the way that humans can interact with computers to improve their lives.
    I would like to explore psychological aspects of human behaviors in order to develop novel agent-human interaction models.
    Good or bad, the future world is going to be more computerized and I believe that it is an essential step to make this interaction more and more humanized."

    role: "PHI PhD Student"
    bio: "As a junior Ph.D. student in Personal Health Informatics at Northeastern University, my research interests are in the intersection of information science,
    computer science and health care. I am particularly interested in the use of Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) in longitudinal health-related behavior interventions.
    My recent research work focuses on identifying patterns of system use in health behavior change interventions with ECAs,
    exploring the use of ECAs to promote optimal breastfeeding behavior, studying the use of ECAs in protocol adherence, using ECAs to report adverse events among cancer patients,
    and investigating the effect of agent alliance on the overall trust in healthcare providers.
    I plan to study more on how mobile ECAs facilitate the collection of cancer-related data and reduce the social desirability bias associated with self-report measures."

    bio: "My interests lie in the intricate relationships among design, human behaviors, culture, and interfaces.
    With the belief that computer agents can be the catalyst for better patient care,
    I plan to study how a relationship between patients and physicians can be simulated and facilitated by conversational agents,
    and how the interaction process and information displayed can be enhanced to achieve better outcomes.
    I’m particularly interested in how a long term human relationship can be simulated with a computer agent and
    what characteristics would contribute to the formation of a successful one.
    Currently I am working on the RESPECT Consent Advocate project, which is using conversational agents to improve the informed consent process for oncology patients.
    I am also working on a project with the Boston Veteran's Administration Medical Center, using conversational agents for screening and brief counseling for alcohol abuse problems in primary care patients."

    bio: "My research interests are in the use of virtual agents for motivational interviewing and counselling, particularly for people with addiction. Additionally, I am interested in the use and development of various language technologies for engaging in natural conversation with virtual agents. Currently I am a part of the effort to create a virtual agent for a preconception care intervention for African American males. My BAs are English Studies, linguistics in particular, and Chinese Studies at the University of Iceland (UI). My master's degree is in Language Technologies (2015) is also from UI, in collaboration with Reykjavik University (RU). During my master's studies I also conducted research at RU's Center for Analysis and Design of Intelligent Agents."
